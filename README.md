# CheatSheet

This repository is going to be dedicated only for little features and functionalities one gets to add/use in his/her project, be it web or mobile.

These functionalities and features can be both frontend and backend.

I'd be more than happy if you could ever contribute to this repository no matter what your expertise be and please do not forget to leave a little readme file for whatever you may contribute just so it may get a little easy for the fellow coders.
